#Welcome to the Front-end test.#

Is going to be very simple. We have a little gallery design.
Your task is to create 3 different markups for this design.

1. Basic HTML + CSS + JS using Bootstrap and whatever other library you feel that you need.

2. Using a framework like Vue, React, etc (What ever you feel comfortable with.)

3. Go to the Squarespace link and locally (Squarespace server) create the CSS/JS needed to achieve the look and behavior of the design.

In this master branch you have the behavior that is expected (gif) and the original pictures used for the design.
